### Introduction

**Flare** lets you broadcast a spontaneous hangout signal — a "flare" — to nearby people when you feel like doing something. You pick an activity and a rough timeframe, fire it off, and anyone nearby who's interested can respond.

No elaborate planning, no formal event pages, and absolutely no commitment until someone bites. Just pure, spontaneous connection.

### Core Features

* **Fire a Flare:** Broadcast an activity (e.g., 🏸 Badminton, ☕ Coffee) + timeframe in just 2 taps. (Limit: One active flare per user at a time).
* **Live Local Map:** Browse a live map of active flares within your configurable radius (1km–20km, default 5km).
* **Low-Friction Matching:** Tap *"I'm in!"* to express interest. The firer can then review and accept or pass.
* **Ephemeral Chat:** A temporary 1:1 chat unlocks only *after* a match is accepted to coordinate the exact location and time.
* **Auto-Expiry:** Flares disappear once their timeframe has passed (or max 24 hours). Chats and connections auto-delete 48 hours after the flare's timeframe ends, keeping the ecosystem fresh.
